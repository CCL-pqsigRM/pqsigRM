This package includes supporting documents, reference implementation, optimized implementation, and KAT for pqsigRM.
This reference implementation and optimized implementation are the implementation of a post-quantum digital signature algorithm, pqsigRM.
The source code is tested under intel x64 cpu, ubuntu 16.04
There are three variants of pqsigRM.

pqsigRM-4-12
	A digital signature algorithm with 128-bit security (Category 1)

pqsigRM-6-12
	A digital signature algorithm with 198-bit security (Category 3)

pqsigRM-6-13
	A digital signature algorithm with 256-bit security (Category 5)


# SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS:

	The source requires ANSI C compiler, and OpenSSL library for C.

# COMPILING:
	This source can be compiled with gcc
	Put your own main file in directory pqsigrm**	

	$ make
